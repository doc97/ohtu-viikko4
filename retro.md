# Retrospective Plans

One of the corner stones of agile development is feedback. And that is the role
of the retrospective meeting. The idea here is that the development team
gathers to discuss what went well and what went less well during the last
iteration. This way the whole team stays up-to-date with how the other team
members perceive the health of the project.

But when it comes to meetings, developers often shy away from them because they
are boring, sometimes confusing and it takes up time that otherwise could have
been used to code. This is why people have come up with certain techniques, or
models for these types of meetings. They specify what to do and also offer some
guidelines on how to do it.

## Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of
This technique focuses on engaging every member at the meeting by asking 5 very
simple and clear questions:

1. What should we start doing?
2. What should we stop doing?
3. What should we continue that we are already doing?
4. Should there be more of something?
5. Should there be less of something?

By answering these five questions a team can quickly identify the major issues
and then focus on coming up with potential solutions.

## Glad, Sad, Mad
This technique is even simpler than the one presented above. It requires a bit
more creative work because the people at the meeting will need to write down
"observations", anything that have affected the last iteration. They are then
categorized to be either Glad, Sad or Mad observations.

With this technique a team concisely gather information about the overall
status and feeling of the project.

## Stay agile
You of course don't need to pick just one technique and then stick to it. Maybe
try a few and combine the things that work for your team.
